## Installation

This package is not yet available on CRAN because it needs further development. You can install the current development version from gitHub using the ```devtools``` package:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjockers/rMallet")
```
You will also need to have [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu) installed on your system and know its location (file path).
